**PPM format** :- 
	Simplest image file format.
	Human-readable.
	Doesn't require any library.
**P3** :
	ASCII color image.
	255 --> maximum color intensity for RGB
```

	P3 --> ascii ppm image
	512 512 --> total 512 column and 512 rows = 262144 total pixels
	255 --> max color value for every r, g, and b value for each pixel --> 255 brightest and 0 the darkest
	*-If  the value was 99 then the brightest would be 99 and darkest would be 0-*
- **The Single data triplet r,g, and b**
	Pixel 1 → (0, 255, 63)
	Pixel 2 → (0, 255, 63)
    Pixel 3 → (1, 255, 63)
    Pixel 4 → (1, 255, 63)
    Pixel 5 → (2, 255, 63)
    Pixel 6 → (2, 255, 63)
	*R is slowely increasing*
	*G is slowely decreasing(here it may  seem constant, but at the end of the full  ppm file it is 0 which means that it is slowely decreasing*
	*B is constant*
- **Mapping Rules**
	The _first pixel_ is the **top-left** pixel of the image.
    Pixels go **left → right**, **row by row**.
    After 512 pixels, you move to the next row.

**Image Flipping**
	if you wanna flip the image just flip the pixels => it'll be flipped.

# 🧠 1. What _is_ a Ray (Concept)

A ray is nothing but a parametric line:

P(t)=A+t⋅b

- **A** = origin
    
- **b** = direction
    
- **t** = parameter (distance along the ray)
Exactly — and you just unlocked the **entire intuition of ray tracing** in one line 😂

Let’s break it down cleanly and deeply (your style), because this analogy is _not only correct_, it's **perfect**.

---

# 🎯 Yes, **P(t) = A + t·b** is the 3D equivalent of **y = mx + c**

Let’s map terms:

|Line Equation|Ray Equation|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|**c**|**A**|Starting point (intercept)|
|**m**|**b**|Direction (slope)|
|**x**|**t**|Parameter you increase to move forward|
|**y(x)**|**P(t)**|Position after moving|

## ✨ The difference:

- `y = mx + c` works in **1D/2D**
    
- `P(t) = A + t·b` works in **3D space**
    

But both describe:

> A point that moves along a straight line as the parameter increases.

---

# 📌 Why the analogy is perfect

### **1. c = intercept**

Just like `c` shifts your line up or down,  
`A` shifts your ray to wherever the camera is.

### **2. m = slope**

Just like slope decides the direction of the line,  
`b` decides which direction the ray travels in 3D.

### **3. x = t**

As `x` increases, you move along the line.  
As `t` increases, you travel forward along the ray.

### **4. y = mx + c → output**

As `P(t)` increases, you get positions in 3D space.

---

# 📐 Visual Intuition

### **In 2D:**

```
y = mx + c  
x = parameter
```

You change x → you move horizontally along the line.

### **In 3D:**

```
P(t) = A + t·b  
t = parameter
```

You change t → you move along the ray in 3D space.

Same concept. Just more axes.

---

# 🔥 Low-level interpretation (you'll love this)

`A + t·b` is literally:

- Start at some address (`A`)
    
- Add `t` copies of a direction vector (`b`)
    
- End up somewhere else in 3D space
    

This is exactly how CPUs walk through points in 3D:  
add → add → add → add

No curves. No fancy math.  
Just linear algebra + a loop.

---

Because hitting an object is simply:

### “Find t where the ray hits the object.”

Every intersection problem becomes:

- Plug P(t) into object equation
    
- Solve for t
    
- If t > 0 → ray hits it
    
- If t < 0 → behind camera, ignore
    

That's why this equation is the **core** of ray tracing.

---

# 🔥 1. How does the ray “move”?

The ray equation:

P(t) = A + t * b  

means:

- Start at **A**
    
- Move in direction **b**
    
- Take **t** steps of size **b**
    

So the ray “moves” by nothing more than:

```
P_next = P_prev + (Δt * b)
```

If Δt = 1 → P = A + b  
If Δt = 0.1 → P = A + 0.1b  
If Δt = 123.789 → P = A + 123.789b

Yes — literally **just adding vectors**.

---

# 🧠 2. Why this works (low-level explanation)

Imagine A is a memory address (not literally, but just imagine):

```
A = [Ax, Ay, Az]
b = [bx, by, bz]
```

Then:

```
P(t) = [
    Ax + t * bx,
    Ay + t * by,
    Az + t * bz
]
```

It's nothing but adding three floats.

The CPU is basically doing this:

```
mul b, t
add A, (b*t)
```

No loops  
No physics  
No integration  
Nothing hardcore

This is why ray tracing is so elegant.

---
# 🎯 4. But how do we _actually_ use it?

We never “animate” the ray by increasing t.  
Instead:

👉 We **solve** for the t where the ray hits an object.  
👉 That tells us _where_ on the ray the collision happens.

---

# 🧨 5. Mind-blowing fact

A ray tracer **never** simulates the ray moving.

It just:

1. Computes the parameter t where something happens
    
2. Uses vector addition to jump directly to that point
    

The ray equation is like a _teleporter_, not a _walking animation_.

---

# 🎥 Building the Camera Step-by-Step

A camera in ray tracing isn’t a real camera.  
It’s just:

- A point in space (the camera center) generally(0,0,0)
    
- A rectangle floating in front of it (the viewport)
    
- A bunch of tiny squares on that rectangle (pixels)
    
- Rays fired from the camera to the middle of each pixel

---

## 📌 **Camera**

- A point in 3D space (usually at `(0,0,0)`).
    
- It looks **toward −Z** in a right-handed coordinate system.
    
- All rays originate from this point.
    

---

## 📌 **Viewport**

Think of the viewport as:

> **A rectangular window floating in front of the camera, representing the entire field of view.**

It is:

- Placed at `z = -focal_length`
    
- A physical size in world-space
    
- Divided into pixels (sub-rectangles)
    

### Viewport size

```cpp
viewport_height = 2.0
viewport_width  = viewport_height * aspect_ratio
```

### Key idea

Viewport size determines **FOV**,  
Image resolution only determines **detail**.

---

# 🧭 **2. Viewport Axes (viewport_u & viewport_v)**

## 🎯 **viewport_u**

- 3D vector pointing **right** across the viewport
    
- Size = viewport width
    
- Example:
    
    ```
    viewport_u = (viewport_width, 0, 0)
    ```
    

## 🎯 **viewport_v**

- 3D vector pointing **DOWN** across the viewport
    
- Yes: DOWN = negative Y
    
- Why?
    
    - Image pixel rows increase downward
        
    - But world Y increases upward
        
    - So we flip sign to synchronize them
        
- Example:
    
    ```
    viewport_v = (0, -viewport_height, 0)
    ```
    

---

# 🧱 **3. World Coordinates vs Image Coordinates**

## 🌍 **World Coordinates**

- Used to define actual 3D positions.
    
- +X → right
    
- +Y → up
    
- −Z → forward
    
- Origin = camera center
    

## 🖼️ **Image (Pixel) Coordinates**

- Used for looping through pixels:
    
    ```
    i = 0 → width-1
    j = 0 → height-1
    ```
    
- Pixel (0,0) = **top-left**
    
- Rows increase **downward**
    

## 🧨 Why we need viewport_v negative?

Because:

- Image j-direction = downward
    
- World +Y = upward
    

So we sync them by defining:

```
viewport_v = (0, -H, 0)
```

This ensures pixel rows map correctly onto the viewport.

**The viewport_u and viewport_v are only here for 3D calculation in vector spaces, these are not actual coordinates which the world-space maps to.**

---

# 🔬 **4. Pixel Spacing (pixel_delta_u, pixel_delta_v)**

These represent the **world-space width & height of one pixel**.
E.g. let say the **world-space width & height is 512 x 512**.
	Dividing the viewport_u and viewport_v into 512 parts equally.

```
pixel_delta_u = viewport_u / image_width
pixel_delta_v = viewport_v / image_height
```

Meaning:

- Move 1 pixel right → add pixel_delta_u
    
- Move 1 pixel down → add pixel_delta_v
    

Each pixel is a tiny rectangle on the viewport.

### Does entire pixel get same color?

✔ **Yes in Chapter 4.**  
We fire **one ray per pixel** → entire pixel = same color.  
(Antialiasing later fires many rays/pixel.)

---

# 🎯 **5. Computing viewport_upper_left**

### Formula:

```cpp
viewport_upper_left =
      camera_center
    - vec3(0,0,focal_length)
    - viewport_u/2
    - viewport_v/2;
```

## 💡 Intuition

### Step 1 → Move from camera to viewport plane

```
camera_center - (0,0,focal_length)
```

### Step 2 → Move LEFT by half-width

```
- viewport_u/2
```

### Step 3 → Move UP by half-height

```
- viewport_v/2
```

⚡ Combine all → You land at the **top-left corner of the viewport**.

---

# 🎯 **6. Computing pixel00_loc (center of first pixel)**

### Formula:

```cpp
pixel00_loc = viewport_upper_left
            + 0.5 * (pixel_delta_u + pixel_delta_v);
```

## 💡 Intuition

- The viewport corner is the _outer_ edge of the screen.
    
- Pixel centers lie **half a pixel inward**.
    

So we move:

- half pixel right
    
- half pixel down
    

That gives the exact **center of pixel (0,0)**.

- **Viewport = physical FOV plane in front of camera.**
    
- **Pixel grid subdivides the viewport.**
    
- **viewport_u & viewport_v = world-space width/height directions.**
    
- **pixel deltas = size of 1 pixel on viewport.**
    
- **viewport_upper_left = corner of viewport.**
    
- **pixel00_loc = center of first pixel (top-left).**
    
- **Rays fire from camera → pixel centers → world.**
