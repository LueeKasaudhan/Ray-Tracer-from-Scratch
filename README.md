# Notes
---

**PPM format** :- 
	Simplest image file format.
	Human-readable.
	Doesn't require any library.
**P3** :
	ASCII color image.
	255 --> maximum color intensity for RGB
```
P3
512 512
255
0 255 63
0 255 63
1 255 63
1 255 63
2 255 63
2 255 63
3 255 63
3 255 63
4 255 63
4 255 63
5 255 63
5 255 63
6 255 63
6 255 63

```
- **This is the Header of the PPM file format**
	P3 --> ascii ppm image
	512 512 --> total 512 column and 512 rows = 262144 total pixels
	255 --> max color value for every r, g, and b value for each pixel --> 255 brightest and 0 the darkest
	*-If  the value was 99 then the brightest would be 99 and darkest would be 0-*
- **The Single data triplet r,g, and b**
	Pixel 1 → (0, 255, 63)
	Pixel 2 → (0, 255, 63)
    Pixel 3 → (1, 255, 63)
    Pixel 4 → (1, 255, 63)
    Pixel 5 → (2, 255, 63)
    Pixel 6 → (2, 255, 63)
	*R is slowely increasing*
	*G is slowely decreasing(here it may  seem constant, but at the end of the full  ppm file it is 0 which means that it is slowely decreasing*
	*B is constant*
- **Mapping Rules**
	The _first pixel_ is the **top-left** pixel of the image.
    Pixels go **left → right**, **row by row**.
    After 512 pixels, you move to the next row.
```
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| px0 | px1 | px2 | px3 | ... | px511                      |  <- Row 0
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| px512 | px513 | px514 | ... | px1023                     |  <- Row 1
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| ...                                                       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Row 511                                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+

```

**Image Flipping**
	if you wanna flip the image just flip the pixels => it'll be flipped.
